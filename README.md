# Github Repository Search Tool

### What is this application?

Github Repository Search Tool is a React application that allows you to search all Github repositories by keywords. Results can be sorted by best match or by the number of watchers (i.e. stars) the repo has. It is designed to be responsive for usage on mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.

### Getting started

1. Clone down the application repo: `git clone git@github.com:relasine/gh-api.git`
2. Navigate into the root of the directory: `cd gh-api`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start up the development server: `npm start`

### Running the test suite

To run the test suite, navigate into the repo's root and use `npm test`
